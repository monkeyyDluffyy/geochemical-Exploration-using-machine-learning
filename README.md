# geochemical-Exploration-using-machine-learning
In tackling the challenge of accurate geochemical exploration, introduces a novel ensemble model combining SVC and Gradient Boosting algorithm. This code compares the hybrid approach with KNN and GNB and explores the stacking approach to enhance detection of types of igneous rocks based on its properties. Futher the performances were measured using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score. Moreover, a confusion matrix was created to interpret the correct classification and misclassifications.
